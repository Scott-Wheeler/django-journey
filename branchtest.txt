This is to test local development on the ScottWheelNett-django-dev branch.
I am not sure if the branch I'm getting is branched from master on my local machine or checkout the remote branch itself.
git checkout -b origin/ScottWheelNett-django-dev

I tried this:
git pull origin ScottWheelNett-django-dev

These edits made on local computer.

[scott@scott-pc django-journey]$ git branch -a
  master
* origin/ScottWheelNett-django-dev
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  remotes/origin/ScottWheelNett-django-dev
  remotes/origin/ScottWheelNett-documentation
  remotes/origin/master
[scott@scott-pc django-journey]$ kate branchtest.txt 

It still doesn't show the * next to a remote branch, but ok


I tried:
[scott@scott-pc django-journey]$ git push
fatal: The current branch origin/ScottWheelNett-django-dev has no upstream branch.
