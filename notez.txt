Versions

I'm going to start with 2.0 though the my operating system, Manjaro KDE (Arch Linux), is living in the past with version 1.11.2, presumably because 1.11 is a LTS distro. Nice release schedule for django as outlined in the docs. Also, it was not a problem to also install django 2 through pip. I did not have to uninstall previous versions of things through pacman, so that's nice too.
