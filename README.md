My journey into Django (thank you GitHub name suggestions)

I'm learning Django, as well as GitHub.

This is going to be fun! :)

I've finished the official tutorial on the Django site.
Next I'm going to do the Django REST Framework tutorial.


All of the edits in this tutorial are being done manually (rather than copypaste) so that I learn more.

1) read a line (or block) of code and understand it
2) try to write the line of code from my understanding of it without referencing the original in the tutorial
3) check the tutorial version to ensure I got it right
4) repeat for all lines
5) test by using the application as applicable
