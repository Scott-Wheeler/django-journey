My journey into Django

I'm learning Django, as well as GitHub.

This is going to be fun! :)

I've already started on the official tutorial on the Django site. I could upload the code I have so far, but that would be less fun. I'm going to start the tutorial from scratch again. I was only on page 2 anyway :P
