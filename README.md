My journey into Django

I'm learning Django.


Versions
I'm going to start with 2.0 though the my operating system, Manjaro KDE (Arch Linux), is living in the past with version 1.11.2, presumably because 1.11 is a LTS distro. Nice release schedule for django as outlined in the docs. Also, it was not a problem to also install django 2 through pip. I did not have to uninstall previous versions of things through pacman, so that's nice too.
