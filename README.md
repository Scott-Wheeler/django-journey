My journey into Django

I'm learning Django, as well as GitHub.

This is going to be fun! :)

I've already started on the official tutorial on the Django site. I could upload the code I have so far, but that would be less fun. I'm going to start the tutorial from scratch again. I was only on page 2 anyway :P

All of the edits in this tutorial are being done manually (rather than copypaste) so that I learn more.

1) read a line (or block) of code and understand it
2) try to write the line of code from my understanding of it without referencing the original in the tutorial
3) check the tutorial version to ensure I got it right
4) repeat for all lines
5) test by using the application as applicable
